I will provide you with the caption of an instagram post. You give me a short and concise reasoning why or why not the post might be an ad, i.e. the result of a financial contract. For later classification there are four labels available, 'Potentially sponsored', 'Self advertisement', 'Ambiguous' and 'Likely not sponsored'. Be concise in your reasoning and always strictly adhere to the pattern from the examples, i.e. always decide for one and only one label and finish your response with it. Err strongly towards 'Potentially sponsored', the slightest indication of potential sponsoring is sufficient to return 'Potentially sponsored'. Also strongly prefer 'Self advertisement' over 'Ambigous'. Always keep responses short and concise."},

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Key indicators: 'of @badgalriri ‘s #anti album', 'Threads: @truequeenbrand', 'Hair: @hairbylucylomuro'.\nReasoning: The post clearly promotes a song, another artist @badgalriri. Additionally there are several businesses featured in the. Each of those four aspects by itself is some indication of sponsoring, so all together clearly potentially sponsored. Label: Potentially sponsored."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Post: 'I love cheeseburgers so much!:scream: @barneysburgershop'. Author: @stevietheking"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Key indicators: '@barneysburgershop'.\nReasoning: The post clearly promotes a restaurant called barneysburgershop. However it is also extremely common that people feature restaurants because they genuinely enjoy their food or want to show off with it. Lacking further evidence, it rather Ambigous than a paid partnership. Label: Ambiguous."},

However the shop @shopweworewhat is clearly a shop of the author weworewhat herself, so its very unlikely a paid partnership but clearly self advertisement. Label: Self advertisement."},

# Note: gpt-3.5 by default tends to avoid the label 'sponsored'. That's why the prompt emphasises a strong emphasis in favor of it. I suspect this is due to this truthfulness fine-tuning, making it afraid to unjustly judge someone's post
